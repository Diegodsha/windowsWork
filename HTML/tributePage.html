          2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2008 and 2009).). He has participated in the top
          category, with the three great motorcycling teams of his time: Honda ,
          Yamaha and Ducati , being since 2013 , a Movistar Yamaha MotoGP rider
          .
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1979</strong> - He was born in Urbino on February 16, 1979.
            His parents are Graziano Rossi and Stefania Palma. He has a brother
            (on his mother's side), Luca Marini , also a motorcycle racer, and a
            sister, Clara Rossi (on his father's side).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1990.</strong> - From a very young age he lived in Tavullia
            , where he began his life in motor sport racing in karts supported
            by his father Graziano . He won the regional championship in this
            year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>125 cc category </strong> - In 1996 he made his debut in the
            world championship in the Aprilia-AGV team and after ten races in
            which he obtained a third place as the best result, he obtained his
            first victory in the Grand Prix of the Czech Republic of
            Motorcycling in Brno.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>250 cc category </strong> - In 1999 Rossi is champion after
            winning 9 races leaving 48 points behind Tohru Ukawa and 100 points
            behind Loris Capirossi, which is worth his promotion to the highest
            category.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>500 cc and MotoGP</strong> <br /><strong

            - In 2003 Rossi won 9 races in the same season. It was his fifth
            world title and the third in a row in the queen class. At the end of
            this season it became known that Rossi had signed for Honda's rival
            brand : Yamaha , due to the differences that HRC had with Rossi. At
            the 2002 Valencia GP, Barros, who had been riding the NSR500 all
            year, got on a 4T for the first time and beat Rossi.

            season he renewed with Yamaha and had very irregular presentations:

            finishes second in Losail, Shanghai and Montmel√≥ (Barcelona) , but

        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <cite
            >-- Currently, he is the rider with the most podium finishes (235)
